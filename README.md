# music-genre-classification

This is a machine project where in I have tried classification and prediction of audio files of 10 different genres.

The dataset was taken from Kaggle, which includes 10 genres, and 100 audio files of each genre. It also came with .csv files

In the code, I have tried feature extraction creating a .csv file

The models used are LogisticRegression, RandomForest, SVM and KNN
